**Spring Boot Internship Project**

Park Ease is a **production-grade Smart Parking Management System** built using **Spring Boot 3**, designed to simulate real-world urban parking operations.
It digitizes the complete parking lifecycle—from **remote booking** to **cashless exit**—while supporting **multiple roles**, **dynamic pricing**, **wallet-based payments**, **real-time updates**, **analytics**, and **audit-grade reporting**.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Stateless **JWT-based Authentication**
- Role-Based Access Control (**ADMIN, AREA_OWNER, GUARD, DRIVER**)
- Automated **Indore city data seeding**
- Wallet + Outstanding Due system (FASTag model)
- Vehicle-slot compatibility enforcement
- **Platform-wide & area-level analytics dashboards**
- **CSV-based reporting for admins, owners, and drivers**
- **Audit logs for all booking and payment activities**
- **Approval-based staff onboarding workflow**
- Production-ready architecture (Service / Repository / DTO layers)

CREATE DATABASE park_ease;
```

---

## 3️⃣ Application Configuration

Update `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
# Server
server.port=8080

# MySQL Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/park_ease?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
spring.datasource.username=YOUR_MYSQL_USERNAME
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

# JPA / Hibernate
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=false
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect

# JWT Security
jwt.secret=CHANGE_THIS_SECRET_FOR_PRODUCTION
```

---

## 4️⃣ Run the Application

### Backend





```bash
git clone https://github.com/chetankhairnar05/Park_Ease_Batch_10.git
cd .\backend\backend\
#change in application.properties first 
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

### Frontend





```bash
cd .\frontend\
npm i
npm run dev
```

On first startup, **AdminSeeder** automatically populates the database with users, areas, slots, guards, vehicles, and pricing data.

---

### Frontend

Open:

**Method 1**

```
http://localhost:5173/
```



# 🌱 Default Seeded Users (Auto-Created)

> All users share the same password for testing.

**Common Password:** `1234`

| AREA_OWNER | [owner3@gmail.com](mailto:owner3@gmail.com) | 1234     |

Each Area Owner:

- Controls **2 parking areas**
- Manages slots, guards, and pricing
- Accesses **area-specific analytics**, **audit logs**, and **CSV exports**

---

## 🚗 Driver Accounts

# 🧠 Application Architecture

## 🔐 Security (JWT + RBAC)

- Stateless authentication
- JWT returned on login
- Token sent in header:

```
X-Auth-Token: <JWT>
```

---

## 🚘 Booking Lifecycle

### 1️⃣ Reservation

- Status: `RESERVED`
- Grace period applied
- Auto-cancel on no-show

### 2️⃣ Arrival

- Status → `ACTIVE_PARKING`
- Timer starts
- Reservation fee waived if on time

### 3️⃣ Exit & Payment

```
Reservation Fee + Parking Fee + Pending Dues
```

- Wallet auto-deduction
- Outstanding dues tracked
- Slot released
- Exit token generated

---

## 💳 Wallet & Due System

- Prepaid wallet per driver
- Automatic billing on exit
- Failed payment → Outstanding Due
- Users blocked from new bookings until cleared

---

## 🚙 Vehicle & Slot Logic

- Vehicle types: **SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE**

---

## 🧩 Real-Time Communication

- Slot updates:

```
/topic/area/{areaId}/slots
```

- Booking updates:

```
/user/queue/booking-updates
```

DTO-based messaging prevents serialization recursion.
